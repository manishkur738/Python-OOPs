    "In Python, `@staticmethod` defines a method that belongs to the class but doesn't access or modify class or instance data, making it act like a regular function placed inside a class. In contrast, `@classmethod` takes the class (`cls`) as its first argument and can access or modify class-level data, making it useful for alternative constructors or class-wide changes.\n"
